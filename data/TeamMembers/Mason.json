During his time in college though, he joined an advanced projects division of IT as a technical writer, where he learned the basic in and outs of code early in his career. He quickly picked up a knack for coding, becoming a front-web developer by his first year, and by the end of his second year, he was a lead student back-end developer for their serverside operations. His real passion though lied in game development still though, and mason worked on multiple individual game projects before founding Gen Games, his senior year in college."

      "paragraph":"Gen Games, a video game development RSO with Illinois State University, was geared towards giving undergraduates the chance to develop games and gain the platform to both learn and practice everything from game code and systems to narrative design. In February of 2020, Gen Games released their first Game, The Tenebris Voyager, to itch.io as well as hosted a game jam at the local games expo for student developers. After the success, and graduating, Mason began working with a number of Gen Games students to produce a separate private studio where they could continue their development work even after school."
